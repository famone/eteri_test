                            At ETERI, we create enduring pieces designed
                            to transcend both time and trends.
                            <br><br>
                            Adhering to a less-but-better mindset, our products
                            are thoughtfully made by skilled craftspeople who employ the finest Eastern fabrics, with little to no waste. To further reduce our carbon footprint, we have collaborated with local artisans on a collection
                            of botanically-dyed natural silk textiles.
                            <br><br>
                            Since the beginning, our packaging has been free
                            of plastic, and our linen bags and cardboard boxes
                            are both recyclable and reusable.
                            <br><br>
                            As a company founded and run by women, ETERI 
                            is committed to supporting female artisans around
                            the world — from Uzbekistan to Mexico — in an effort
                            to encourage slow fashion and preserve traditional
                            craft and techniques.
