                            Garments are made of ikat â€” Uzbek silk. It is recommended to dry cleaning only. Also avoid contact with chemicals, perfume, hot and cold water on the product.
                            <br><br>
                            We strongly recommend using a steamless iron instead of a steamer to smooth the fabrics to avoid damage 
                            of the product.
                            <br><br>
                            The fabric is woven and dyed by hand by hereditary masters. Dyes are natural: from flowers, seeds, coal 
                            and tree roots. Therefore, products require careful handling and care.
                            <br><br>
                            On the fabric, it is possible to find dense threads that may look like hooks. This is not a defect, it indicates 
                            that the fabric was hand-woven, not on a factory loom.
